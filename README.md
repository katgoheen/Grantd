The Vision 

Granted is a milestone-based granting platform for sponsors and developers to issue and apply for grants. Streamlining the grant process by notifying and tracking all the progress on projects being built so that both the developer and sponsor have open, bidirectional communication. Itâ€™s something we like to call transparency.
